# Product: Personal Development Environment

## Vision
A single-source-of-truth repository for personal shell, editor, and tooling configurations that can be rapidly deployed across Linux and macOS devices.

## Target Audience
- Primary: Personal use by the author
- Secondary: Public reference for others seeking configuration patterns and tooling inspiration

## Key Value Propositions
- **Consistency**: Replicate identical configurations across multiple machines
- **Speed**: Bootstrap a fully configured development environment via a single setup script
- **Portability**: Support both Linux and macOS ecosystems
- **Transparency**: Public reference repository for configuration best practices

## Core Configurations Managed
- Shell configurations (.zshrc, .zprofile, .zshenv)
- Editor configurations (.vimrc, .emacs, .ideavimrc)
- Git configurations (.gitconfig, .githelpers, .gitmessage)
- Tool configurations (.psqlrc, .yarnrc.yml, .todo.cfg)
- System bootstrapping (Brewfile for macOS, setup.sh for universal setup)
