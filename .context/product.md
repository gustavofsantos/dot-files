# Product Context

## Purpose
This project is a comprehensive set of "dotfiles" and custom CLI utilities designed to create a highly efficient, context-driven development environment. It manages configurations for essential developer tools and provides a suite of custom scripts to streamline workflows.

## Key Features
- **Environment Management:** Automated setup and linking of configuration files using GNU Stow and a custom `setup.sh` script.
- **Context-Driven Development (CDD):** A specialized workflow (and supporting scripts) that uses the file system as an extended memory for LLM-assisted engineering.
- **Enhanced CLI Workflow:** A collection of custom scripts in `bin/` for advanced git operations, testing, linting, and productivity (e.g., `tmux-sessionizer`, `asknotes`, `today`, `week`).
- **Modern Editor Config:** A sophisticated Neovim setup with a focus on productivity, specialized for various languages (Clojure, Lua, etc.).

## Target Audience
The primary user is a software engineer (gsantos) who favors XP-disciplined development, TDD, and leveraging LLMs within a structured, terminal-based environment.
