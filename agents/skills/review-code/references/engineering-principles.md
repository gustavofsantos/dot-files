# Modern Software Engineering Principles
Evaluate the change based on these five hallmarks of professional engineering:

1. Iteration: Is the change small enough to be understood and reverted quickly?
2. Feedback: Does the change include enough automated checks to provide rapid signal to the team?
3. Incrementality: Does this change add a vertical slice of functionality that can be deployed independently?
4. Experimentation: Does the developer treat the change as an experiment with a clear prediction (the test)?
5. Empiricism: Is the solution based on real-world requirements and production-readiness, or ivory-tower speculation?
6. Deployability: If the tests pass, should we feel confident enough to ship this immediately to production?
